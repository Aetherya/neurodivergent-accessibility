# Bachelor Thesis

## Abstract

This is a React project aiming to summarise and broadcast information about neurodiversity, and how a neurodivergent user base might inform design decisions in the webspace. Using research from the written part of the Thesis, the website suggests alternatives to current web standards, which aim to support neurodivergent users and aid them when browsing the Internet.

### Structure

-   An Introduction and Overview to Neurodiversity
-   Goals of Web Design and how to accommodate for neurodivergent users
-   A Component Library suggesting alternative design structures
-   Further Research and Potential Pitfalls

## How to run the code
